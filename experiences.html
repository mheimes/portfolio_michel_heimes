          At the end of 2019, I completed a four-month internship at Pluggi GmbH, a start up that created an online sneaker marketplace. There I learned especially about the field of online marketing and worked on the constant updating of the company website, which was built using Wordpress.

          In May 2022, I took part in the two-day Proptech Heckathon organized by Powerhouse Köln e.V.. The aim was to develop concrete approaches of digital solutions for the construction and real estate industry that can make a sustainable contribution to climate protection. <br>
          In this context, my team and I designed a comparison platform for property developers that enables them to find not only the most cost-effective but also the most sustainable suppliers and service providers for their construction project, according to the different services in their specifications.

        Leading with personality - Seminar

          Against the background that I am very passionate about entrepreneurship and would like to expand my skills and knowledge wherever possible, I participated in August 2022 in the seminar "Leading with Personality", which was offered by Beate Mies as part of the Competence Workshop of the TH Cologne. <br>
          The seminar focused on the conflicting interests of the company on the one hand and the employees on the other and provided insights and helpful approaches that young managers in particular need. This included clarity of goals and roles as well as the ability to assess their own (leadership) personality. Motivating leadership means offering others opportunities to contribute their competencies, skills and knowledge in the best possible way.
