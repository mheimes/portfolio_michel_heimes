        <h1>Headings Are Block Elements</h1>

        <p>Paragraphs are block, too. <em>However</em>, &lt;em&gt; and &lt;strong&gt; elements are not. They are <strong>inline</strong> elements.</p>

        <!-- This is how you avoid margin collapse -> see more to this in the box-styles.css file! -->
        <div style="padding-top: 1px"></div>

        <p>Block elements define the flow of the HTML document, while inline elements do not.</p>

        <div>Button</div>
    </body>

    Important learnings from this chapter:
    
    1. Everything is a box!
    2. Boxes can be inline or block-level.
    3. Boxes have content, paddings, borders and margins.
    4. They also have seemingly arbitrary rules about how they interact.
    5. Mastering the CSS box model means you can lay out most web pages.
