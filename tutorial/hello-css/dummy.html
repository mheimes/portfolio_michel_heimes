        <p>This is a dummy page that helps us demonstrate reusable CSS stylesheets. <a href="hello-css.html">Go back</a>.</p>

        <!-- Like page-specific styles, this is the same CSS syntax we've been working with.
        However, since it's an attrubute, it needs to be condensed to a single line.-->
        <!-- Inline styles are most specific way to define CSS.-->
        <!-- Inline styles should be avoided at all costs because they make it IMPOSSIBLE 
        to alter styles from an external stylesheet.-->
        <!-- Instead of inline styles use CSS classes!-->
        <p>Want to try crossing out an <a href="nowhere.html" style="color: #990000; text-decoration: line-through;">obsolete link</a>? This is your chance!</p>
