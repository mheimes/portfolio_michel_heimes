        <h2>Character Sets</h2>
        <p>You can use UTF-8 to count in Turkish:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>bir</li>
            <li>iki</li>
            <li>üç</li>
            <li>dört</li>
            <li>beş</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>HTML Entities</h2>
        <p>There are three reserved characters in HTML: &lt; &gt; and &amp;. You should always use HTML entities for these three characters.</p>
        <p>If you&rsquo;re into &ldquo;web typography,&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll also find yourself using curly quotes a bit.<br>
        Since we are now usinf a UTF-8 character set, we should be able to insert any character directly into the HTML document.</p>
