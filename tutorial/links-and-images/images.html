        <h1>Images</h1>
        <p>This page covers common image formats, but you may also be looking for <a href="links.html">links</a> and <a href="misc/extras.html">useful extras</a>.</p>

        <!--The width attribute within the <img> sets an explicit dimension for the image.-->
        <!--There's a corresponding height attribute, as well.-->
        <!--Setting only one of them will cause the image to scale proportionally, while defining both will stretch the image.-->

        <!--The width and height attributes can be useful, but it's usually better to set image dimensions with CSS so you can alter them with media queries.-->

        <h2>JPGs</h2>
        <p>JPG images are good for photos. They are designed for handling large color palettes without exorbitantly increasing file size.</p>

        <h2>GIFs</h2>
        <p>GIFs are good for animations. They are limited in terms of color palette - never use them for photos.</p>

        <h2>PNGs</h2>
        <p>PNGs are good for diagrams and icons - anything that's not a photo or animated.<br>
        For photos, a PNG file of the same quality (as perceived by the human eye) would generally be bigger than an equivalent JPG file.</p>
        <img src="images/mochi.png" width="75" alt="A mochi ball"/>

        <h2>SVGs</h2>
        <p>SVGs are <em>amazing</em>. Use them wherever you can.<br>
        It's a vector-based graphics, meaning it can scale up or down to <em>any</em> dimension without loss of quality.<br>
        They are great for responsive design!</p>
